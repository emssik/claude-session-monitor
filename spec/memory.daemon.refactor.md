## Task: Phase 1 - Critical Issues Implementation

**Date:** 2025-01-06
**Status:** Success

### 1. Summary
* **Problem:** Critical daemon issues: 5 different ccusage execution methods, race conditions in subprocess pool, notification spam with hundreds of duplicate alerts
* **Solution:** Implemented unified architecture with CcusageExecutor (strategy pattern), ImprovedSubprocessPool (thread-safe), and NotificationTracker (rate limiting)

### 2. Reasoning & Justification

* **Architectural Choices:** 
  - **Strategy Pattern for CcusageExecutor**: Chosen over inheritance to allow runtime strategy switching and clean separation of concerns. Alternative was factory pattern, but Strategy provides better flexibility for fallback mechanisms. Enables graceful degradation when primary execution method fails (e.g., launchd fork restrictions).
  
  - **Event-driven synchronization for SubprocessPool**: Replaced busy waiting (`time.sleep(0.1)` loops) with `threading.Event` coordination. Alternative was condition variables, but Events provide clearer semantics for completion signaling. Eliminates CPU waste and timing issues that caused race conditions.
  
  - **Message-specific notification tracking**: Tracks (notification_type, message) tuples rather than just types. Alternative was type-only tracking, but message-specific prevents legitimate different notifications from being blocked (e.g., "5 minutes remaining" vs "3 minutes remaining").

* **Library/Dependency Choices:**
  - **Python standard library threading primitives**: Used `threading.Lock`, `threading.Event`, `queue.Queue` instead of external libraries like `asyncio` or `concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor`. Reasoning: Existing codebase uses threading, minimal dependencies, proven reliability for this use case. asyncio would require major refactoring of synchronous code.
  
  - **No external rate limiting libraries**: Implemented custom NotificationTracker instead of using libraries like `ratelimit` or `limits`. Reasoning: Custom solution provides exact control needed for notification-specific requirements (message-based tracking, per-type cooldowns, integration with existing enum system).

* **Method/Algorithm Choices:**
  - **Automatic fallback mechanism**: WrapperScriptStrategy → DirectSubprocessStrategy → OSSystemStrategy. Chosen over manual configuration because it provides self-healing behavior in different environments (launchd restrictions, missing dependencies, path issues).
  
  - **Per-message tracking with cleanup**: Used dictionary with (type, message) keys and automatic expired entry cleanup. Alternative was LRU cache, but time-based expiration is more appropriate for rate limiting than size-based eviction.

* **Testing Strategy:**
  - **TDD approach with real concurrency tests**: Wrote failing tests first, then implemented solutions. Used actual threading and subprocess execution rather than mocks for race condition detection. Reasoning: Race conditions and threading issues can't be reliably tested with mocks - need real concurrent execution.
  
  - **Integration tests with existing NotificationManager**: Verified compatibility with existing enum system and notification infrastructure. Critical because rate limiting must work with current notification delivery mechanisms without breaking changes.

* **Other Key Decisions:**
  - **Enum aliasing accommodation**: Discovered that NotificationType.TIME_WARNING and INACTIVITY_ALERT are aliases (same value "normal"). Instead of changing the enum (breaking change), designed tracker to handle aliases correctly. This maintains backward compatibility while providing rate limiting functionality.
  
  - **Global singleton pattern with proper initialization**: Used module-level singletons with lazy initialization and thread-safe access for both subprocess pool and notification tracker. Alternative was dependency injection, but singletons provide simpler integration with existing daemon architecture.

### 3. Process Log
* **Actions Taken:**
  1. **Task 1.1**: Created CcusageExecutor with Strategy pattern - unified 5 different execution methods into single interface with WrapperScriptStrategy, DirectSubprocessStrategy, OSSystemStrategy and automatic fallback
  2. **Task 1.2**: Implemented ImprovedSubprocessPool - replaced busy waiting with event-based synchronization, added proper locking for cache operations, resource monitoring with statistics
  3. **Task 1.3**: Built NotificationTracker - message-specific rate limiting with configurable cooldown periods, thread-safe operations, integration with existing NotificationType enum

* **Challenges Encountered:**
  - **Enum aliasing issue**: TIME_WARNING and INACTIVITY_ALERT enums have same value, causing dictionary key collisions. Solved by accommodating aliases in tests and documentation rather than breaking changes.
  - **Fork restrictions in launchd**: Original subprocess approach failed in daemon environment. Addressed through multiple execution strategies with automatic fallback.
  - **Race condition detection**: Required careful test design using real threading rather than mocks to verify thread safety fixes.

* **New Dependencies:** None - all implementations use Python standard library only
