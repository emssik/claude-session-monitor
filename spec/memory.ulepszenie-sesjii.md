## Task: Phase 2 - Session Cleanup Logic Improvements
**Date:** 2025-01-07
**Status:** Success

### 1. Analysis
From the epic plan, I need to work on Phase 2 which involves:
- Task 2.1: Implementing improved cleanup logic for 5h billing window
- Task 2.2: Integration with daemon for automatic cleanup

Current state analysis:
- The `cleanup_completed_billing_sessions()` method already exists in `session_activity_tracker.py`
- It's designed to clear activity sessions outside the 5h billing window
- The method clears the log file and memory cache
- Issue: May not be called properly by the daemon or has timing issues

### 2. Action Plan
1. **Create comprehensive test**: Write `test_billing_window_cleanup` to verify the cleanup behavior
2. **Analyze current implementation**: Check if `cleanup_completed_billing_sessions()` works correctly
3. **Fix any issues**: Improve the method if needed
4. **Integration testing**: Ensure daemon calls the cleanup method
5. **Daemon integration**: Add proper calls to the main daemon loop

### 2. Reasoning & Justification

**Architectural Choices:**
- **Method Enhancement over Rewrite**: Enhanced the existing `cleanup_completed_billing_sessions()` method rather than creating a new class structure. This maintains backward compatibility and leverages existing infrastructure.
- **Daemon Integration Pattern**: Added SessionActivityTracker as a component of ClaudeDaemon, following the same pattern as DataCollector and NotificationManager. This provides consistent lifecycle management.
- **File-based Communication**: Continued using the existing file-based approach for daemon-client communication, ensuring no breaking changes to the architecture.

**Method/Algorithm Choices:**
- **Separate Logic for Old vs Recent Sessions**: Modified the logic to always remove old sessions from memory while only clearing the log file if ALL sessions are old. This provides more granular cleanup behavior.
- **5-Hour Billing Window**: Used a hard-coded 5-hour window as specified in the business requirements, matching Anthropic's billing session logic.
- **Defensive Error Handling**: Wrapped cleanup calls in try-catch blocks to ensure daemon stability even if cleanup fails.

**Testing Strategy:**
- **TDD Methodology**: Followed strict RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycles with 3 comprehensive test cases covering: all-old sessions (clears log), mixed old/recent sessions (preserves recent), and all-recent sessions (no changes).
- **Integration Testing**: Created daemon integration tests to verify the cleanup method is called automatically during normal operation, using mocking to isolate behavior.
- **Edge Case Coverage**: Tested boundary conditions including exactly 5h, just under 5h, and well over 5h time differences.

**Library/Dependency Choices:**
- **Standard Library Only**: No new dependencies were added, maintaining the project's goal of using only Python standard library.
- **unittest Framework**: Used the existing unittest framework for consistency with the project's testing approach.
- **Mock Integration**: Used unittest.mock for isolation testing without requiring external mock libraries.

**Other Key Decisions:**
- **Periodic Cleanup Frequency**: Integrated cleanup with the existing data collection cycle (every 10 seconds by default) rather than creating a separate timer. This reduces complexity and ensures cleanup happens regularly without additional threads.
- **Log File Truncation Strategy**: Used file truncation (open with 'w' mode) rather than file deletion to maintain file permissions and avoid potential race conditions with log writers.
- **Memory Cache Reset**: Ensured file modification cache and timestamps are reset when the log file is cleared, preventing stale cache issues.

### 3. Process Log

**Actions Taken:**
1. Created comprehensive test suite with 3 test cases in `test_session_activity_tracker.py`
2. Fixed existing `cleanup_completed_billing_sessions()` logic in `session_activity_tracker.py`
3. Added SessionActivityTracker import and initialization to `claude_daemon.py`
4. Integrated cleanup calls into the daemon's `_collect_data()` method
5. Created daemon integration tests in `test_daemon.py`
6. Verified all 262 tests pass with no regressions

**Challenges Encountered:**
- Initial test logic was incorrect - expected all sessions to be removed even when recent sessions should be preserved
- MonitoringData test fixtures required all fields to be provided for proper mocking
- Original daemon test was too aggressive with mocking, preventing the actual cleanup integration from being tested

**New Dependencies:** 
None - all changes used existing Python standard library and project infrastructure.

## Task: Phase 3 - Screen Cleaning Improvements
**Date:** 2025-07-07
**Status:** Success

### 1. Summary
* **Problem:** Screen "garbage" remains when transitioning between active and waiting session states due to anti-flicker optimization that only clears screen on activity session changes, not main session state changes
* **Solution:** Enhanced screen clearing logic to detect main session state transitions (active ↔ waiting) and force full screen clear during these transitions while preserving existing anti-flicker behavior for normal updates

### 2. Reasoning & Justification

**Architectural Choices:**
- **Incremental Enhancement over Rewrite**: Extended the existing screen clearing logic in `render_full_display()` method rather than creating a new display architecture. This maintains backward compatibility and leverages the existing anti-flicker system.
- **State Transition Detection Pattern**: Added `main_session_state_changed` detection alongside existing `sessions_changed` logic, following the same pattern used for audio signal detection. This provides consistent state change handling across the system.
- **Preserving Anti-flicker Design**: Maintained the existing `self._screen_cleared` flag and `move_to_top()` optimization for normal updates, only forcing `clear_screen()` when state transitions occur.

**Method/Algorithm Choices:**
- **Dual Condition Logic**: Used separate detection for activity session changes (`sessions_changed`) and main session state changes (`main_session_state_changed`) to handle different types of screen refresh scenarios appropriately.
- **Previous State Tracking**: Extended the existing `_previous_session_state` tracking to detect transitions, similar to how `_previous_activity_sessions` works for activity session changes.
- **Null-safe State Comparison**: Added null check (`self._previous_session_state is not None`) to prevent false positives on first render when previous state hasn't been established.

**Testing Strategy:**
- **TDD Methodology**: Followed strict RED-GREEN-REFACTOR approach with comprehensive test `test_screen_clear_on_transition` that covers multiple transition scenarios: first render, same state (anti-flicker), and bi-directional state transitions.
- **Mock-based Testing**: Used `unittest.mock.patch.object` to isolate and verify specific method calls (`clear_screen()` vs `move_to_top()`) without depending on actual screen output, ensuring precise behavior verification.
- **State Transition Coverage**: Tested complete cycle: active → active (no clear), active → waiting (clear), waiting → waiting (no clear), waiting → active (clear) to ensure all transition scenarios work correctly.

**Library/Dependency Choices:**
- **Standard Library Only**: No new dependencies added, maintaining the project's philosophy of using only Python standard library. Used existing `unittest.mock` for testing isolation.
- **Existing Infrastructure**: Leveraged existing `Colors`, `DisplayManager` class structure, and `MonitoringData` test fixtures to ensure consistency with project patterns.

**Other Key Decisions:**
- **Granular State Detection**: Added `main_session_state_changed` as a separate condition rather than modifying the existing `sessions_changed` logic, ensuring that each type of change can be handled independently and debugged separately.
- **Immediate State Update**: Continued updating `_previous_session_state` before screen clearing decision to ensure state tracking remains accurate for subsequent calls.
- **Backwards Compatibility**: Ensured all existing screen clearing behavior remains unchanged - first run still clears, activity session changes still clear, only added new clearing for main session state transitions.

### 3. Process Log

**Actions Taken:**
1. Analyzed existing `render_full_display()` method to understand current screen clearing logic (lines 575-580)
2. Created comprehensive TDD test `test_screen_clear_on_transition` with 5 transition scenarios
3. Verified test fails (RED phase) - confirmed current logic doesn't clear screen on state transitions
4. Implemented fix by adding `main_session_state_changed` detection and extending clearing condition
5. Verified test passes (GREEN phase) and all existing display manager tests continue to pass
6. Ran integration tests to ensure no regressions in broader system

**Challenges Encountered:**
- Initial analysis revealed the anti-flicker system was designed primarily for activity session changes, not main session state transitions
- Had to carefully balance preserving the anti-flicker optimization while adding necessary screen clearing for state transitions
- Test design required precise mocking to verify method calls without interfering with actual output

**New Dependencies:** 
None - all changes used existing Python standard library and unittest framework infrastructure.
