## Task: Migration of claude_activity.log to system-wide location
**Date:** Tue Jul  8 14:37:27 CEST 2025
**Status:** Success

### 1. Summary
* **Problem:** The claude_activity.log file was located in user-specific directory `~/.config/claude-monitor/hooks/` making it inaccessible for other services and applications that wanted to integrate with Claude session monitoring.
* **Solution:** Migrated the log file to `/tmp/claude-monitor/claude_activity.log` system-wide location, updated all hook scripts to use the new path, and created comprehensive documentation for third-party integration.

### 2. Reasoning & Justification
* **Architectural Choices:** 
  - Chose `/tmp/claude-monitor/` over `/var/log/` because it's more accessible for third-party applications without requiring root privileges
  - Maintained single log file approach (no date suffixes) for simplicity of integration
  - Preserved existing JSON Lines format for backward compatibility
  
* **Library/Dependency Choices:** 
  - No new dependencies added - used existing atomic file operations and threading locks
  - Maintained compatibility with existing HookLogger class for thread-safe operations
  
* **Method/Algorithm Choices:** 
  - Updated constants in centralized location (`src/shared/constants.py`) to ensure system-wide consistency
  - Modified all hook scripts (`notification_hook.py`, `stop_hook.py`, `activity_hook.py`) to use new default path
  - Daemon's `SessionActivityTracker` automatically picked up new path through constants import
  
* **Testing Strategy:** 
  - Verified existing system continued working by checking daemon logs and real-time log updates
  - Confirmed hooks write to new location by monitoring `/tmp/claude-monitor/claude_activity.log`
  - No regression testing needed as format and functionality remained identical
  
* **Other Key Decisions:** 
  - Created detailed documentation in `docs/claude_activity_log.md` with integration examples for Python, Shell, and real-time monitoring
  - Updated CLAUDE.md with proper documentation references
  - Maintained environment variable override (`CLAUDE_ACTIVITY_LOG_FILE`) for custom deployments

### 3. Process Log
* **Actions Taken:** 
  1. Changed `HOOK_LOG_DIR` constant from `~/.config/claude-monitor/hooks` to `/tmp/claude-monitor`
  2. Updated default paths in all three hook scripts to use new location
  3. Created comprehensive documentation in `docs/claude_activity_log.md`
  4. Updated CLAUDE.md with documentation references and new paths
  5. Created `/tmp/claude-monitor/` directory and verified system functionality
  
* **Challenges Encountered:** 
  - Initially missed updating hook scripts - only changed constants.py
  - Had to ensure all components (hooks, daemon, parser) used consistent path resolution
  - Needed to maintain backward compatibility with environment variable override
  
* **New Dependencies:** None - used existing infrastructure

### 4. Files Modified
* `src/shared/constants.py` - Updated HOOK_LOG_DIR constant
* `hooks/notification_hook.py` - Updated default log path
* `hooks/stop_hook.py` - Updated default log path  
* `hooks/activity_hook.py` - Updated default log path
* `docs/claude_activity_log.md` - Created comprehensive documentation
* `CLAUDE.md` - Updated with new paths and documentation references

### 5. Integration Impact
* **Third-party Applications:** Can now access log file without user-specific paths
* **System Services:** Have read access to `/tmp/claude-monitor/claude_activity.log`
* **Real-time Monitoring:** Documented approaches for file watching and streaming
* **Backward Compatibility:** Environment variable override preserved for custom setups
