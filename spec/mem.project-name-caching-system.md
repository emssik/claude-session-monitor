## Task: Symlink Infrastructure - Compatibility Layer Implementation
**Date:** 2025-07-10 10:29:14
**Status:** Success

### 1. Summary
* **Problem:** Project cache file was stored in ~/.config/claude-monitor/ instead of /tmp/claude-monitor/ as specified in the project specification, causing compatibility issues
* **Solution:** Implemented automatic symlink creation in daemon startup to link /tmp/claude-monitor/project_cache.json to ~/.config/claude-monitor/project_cache.json for spec compliance while maintaining data persistence

### 2. Reasoning & Justification
* **Architectural Choices:** 
  - Chose symlink approach over moving files to preserve data persistence across system restarts
  - Implemented symlink creation in daemon __init__ method to ensure it's always available when system starts
  - Used existing HOOK_LOG_DIR constant (/tmp/claude-monitor) for consistency with other temporary files
  - Applied atomic symlink creation with proper cleanup of existing files/links

* **Library/Dependency Choices:** 
  - Used only standard library (os, logging) to maintain project's zero-dependency philosophy
  - Leveraged existing constants and utilities (HOOK_LOG_DIR, get_project_cache_file_path)
  - Chose os.symlink() over alternatives for direct filesystem link creation
  - Used os.path.islink() for proper link detection before cleanup

* **Method/Algorithm Choices:** 
  - Implemented defensive programming with proper link/file cleanup before creation
  - Used os.makedirs(exist_ok=True) to ensure target directory exists
  - Applied graceful error handling with warning logs instead of crashes
  - Chose to integrate into existing daemon lifecycle rather than separate setup script

* **Testing Strategy:** 
  - Used live daemon restart to verify symlink creation functionality
  - Applied process-based testing by killing daemon and waiting for cron restart
  - Tested error handling by checking daemon logs for proper warning messages
  - Verified real symlink creation by examining /tmp/claude-monitor/ directory contents

* **Other Key Decisions:** 
  - Stored real cache file in persistent location (~/.config/claude-monitor/) for data durability
  - Created symlink in temporary location (/tmp/claude-monitor/) for spec compliance
  - Integrated symlink setup into daemon initialization for automatic maintenance
  - Used warning-level logging for symlink failures to avoid daemon crash on permission issues

### 3. Process Log
* **Actions Taken:** 
  - Added _setup_symlinks() method to ClaudeDaemon class in claude_daemon.py
  - Integrated symlink setup call into daemon __init__ method after component initialization
  - Fixed import issue by using HOOK_LOG_DIR constant instead of non-existent DEFAULT_TMP_DIR
  - Implemented proper error handling and cleanup logic for existing files/symlinks
  - Updated daemon restart procedure to use process kill + cron auto-restart pattern

* **Challenges Encountered:** 
  - Initial import error with DEFAULT_TMP_DIR constant that didn't exist in constants.py
  - Fixed by using existing HOOK_LOG_DIR constant that contains /tmp/claude-monitor path
  - Needed to understand proper daemon restart procedure (kill + wait for cron) instead of manual restart
  - Required careful handling of existing files vs symlinks in target location

* **New Dependencies:** None - maintained zero-dependency requirement using only standard library and existing project infrastructure

  - Implemented ProjectCache as a separate class responsible for persistence operations, following single responsibility principle
  - Used dictionary mapping from project_name to ProjectInfo for efficient lookups
  - Applied atomic file operations pattern (temporary file + rename) for thread safety

* **Library/Dependency Choices:** 
  - Used only standard library (json, os, tempfile, datetime, typing) to maintain project's zero-dependency philosophy
  - Avoided external dependencies like fcntl or flock to maintain cross-platform compatibility

* **Method/Algorithm Choices:** 
  - Implemented os.path.basename() for project name extraction from git root path
  - Used datetime.now(timezone.utc) for timezone-aware timestamps

* **Testing Strategy:** 
  - Followed strict TDD approach (RED-GREEN-REFACTOR) for all components
  - Created comprehensive test coverage with 8 test cases covering both ProjectInfo and ProjectCache
  - Included concurrent operation tests to verify thread safety
  - Used tempfile for test isolation and proper cleanup
  - Tested edge cases like non-existent files, duplicate aliases, and concurrent access

* **Other Key Decisions:** 
  - Chose to extract project name from git root basename rather than complex parsing
  - Implemented graceful degradation with empty dict return for file errors
  - Used os.fsync() to ensure data durability before atomic rename
  - Stored timestamps in ISO format for JSON serialization compatibility

* **Actions Taken:** 
  - Created tests/test_project_models.py with comprehensive test suite
  - Implemented src/shared/project_models.py with ProjectInfo and ProjectCache classes
  - Added atomic file operations using tempfile + rename pattern
  - Verified thread safety with concurrent operation tests

* **Challenges Encountered:** 
  - Initial test setup required proper Python path configuration for imports
  - Needed to design JSON serialization format for datetime objects
  - Had to implement proper cleanup in tests using try/finally blocks

* **New Dependencies:** None - maintained zero-dependency requirement using only standard library

**Status:** Success

### 1. Summary
* **Problem:** Implement GitResolver class to provide git repository detection and project name extraction functionality for the project name caching system
* **Solution:** Created robust GitResolver with get_git_root() and get_project_name_from_git_root() methods using subprocess git calls and path manipulation

### 2. Reasoning & Justification
* **Architectural Choices:**

## Task: Phase 3 - Core Resolver - Main Logic Implementation
**Date:** 2025-07-09 21:38:25
**Status:** Success

### 1. Summary
* **Problem:** Implement the core ProjectNameResolver class that orchestrates all components (ProjectCache, GitResolver) to provide intelligent project name resolution with caching and fallback mechanisms
* **Solution:** Created comprehensive ProjectNameResolver with cache-first approach, adaptive learning, and graceful error handling, following TDD methodology with extensive test coverage

### 2. Reasoning & Justification

  - Created unit tests to verify new function behavior in isolation
  - Developed integration tests to verify all hooks work together consistently
  - Used mock patching to test error scenarios and verify correct function calls
  - Included real-world git repository tests to validate actual resolver integration

  - Required proper test isolation and mock setup to verify function calls correctly

* **New Dependencies:** None - maintained zero-dependency requirement using only standard library and existing ProjectNameResolver components from previous phases
