## Task: Phase 1 - Fundamenty - Data Models i Cache Infrastructure
**Date:** 2025-07-09 19:51:52
**Status:** Success

### 1. Summary
* **Problem:** Implement foundational data models and cache infrastructure for the project name caching system to provide stable project identification across hook calls
* **Solution:** Created ProjectInfo data model and ProjectCache class with atomic file operations, following TDD methodology for robust implementation

### 2. Reasoning & Justification
* **Architectural Choices:** 
  - Chose simple class-based approach for ProjectInfo to store git_root, project_name, aliases, and last_accessed timestamp
  - Implemented ProjectCache as a separate class responsible for persistence operations, following single responsibility principle
  - Used dictionary mapping from project_name to ProjectInfo for efficient lookups
  - Applied atomic file operations pattern (temporary file + rename) for thread safety

* **Library/Dependency Choices:** 
  - Used only standard library (json, os, tempfile, datetime, typing) to maintain project's zero-dependency philosophy
  - Avoided external dependencies like fcntl or flock to maintain cross-platform compatibility
  - Chose tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile for atomic operations over custom temporary file handling

* **Method/Algorithm Choices:** 
  - Implemented os.path.basename() for project name extraction from git root path
  - Used datetime.now(timezone.utc) for timezone-aware timestamps
  - Applied JSON serialization for human-readable cache files
  - Implemented atomic save pattern: write to temp file ’ fsync ’ rename for ACID properties

* **Testing Strategy:** 
  - Followed strict TDD approach (RED-GREEN-REFACTOR) for all components
  - Created comprehensive test coverage with 8 test cases covering both ProjectInfo and ProjectCache
  - Included concurrent operation tests to verify thread safety
  - Used tempfile for test isolation and proper cleanup
  - Tested edge cases like non-existent files, duplicate aliases, and concurrent access

* **Other Key Decisions:** 
  - Chose to extract project name from git root basename rather than complex parsing
  - Implemented graceful degradation with empty dict return for file errors
  - Used os.fsync() to ensure data durability before atomic rename
  - Stored timestamps in ISO format for JSON serialization compatibility

### 3. Process Log
* **Actions Taken:** 
  - Created tests/test_project_models.py with comprehensive test suite
  - Implemented src/shared/project_models.py with ProjectInfo and ProjectCache classes
  - Added atomic file operations using tempfile + rename pattern
  - Verified thread safety with concurrent operation tests

* **Challenges Encountered:** 
  - Initial test setup required proper Python path configuration for imports
  - Needed to design JSON serialization format for datetime objects
  - Had to implement proper cleanup in tests using try/finally blocks

* **New Dependencies:** None - maintained zero-dependency requirement using only standard library
