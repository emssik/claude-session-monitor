## Task: Phase 1 - Fundamenty - Data Models i Cache Infrastructure
**Date:** 2025-07-09 19:51:52
**Status:** Success

### 1. Summary
* **Problem:** Implement foundational data models and cache infrastructure for the project name caching system to provide stable project identification across hook calls
* **Solution:** Created ProjectInfo data model and ProjectCache class with atomic file operations, following TDD methodology for robust implementation

### 2. Reasoning & Justification
* **Architectural Choices:** 
  - Chose simple class-based approach for ProjectInfo to store git_root, project_name, aliases, and last_accessed timestamp
  - Implemented ProjectCache as a separate class responsible for persistence operations, following single responsibility principle
  - Used dictionary mapping from project_name to ProjectInfo for efficient lookups
  - Applied atomic file operations pattern (temporary file + rename) for thread safety

* **Library/Dependency Choices:** 
  - Used only standard library (json, os, tempfile, datetime, typing) to maintain project's zero-dependency philosophy
  - Avoided external dependencies like fcntl or flock to maintain cross-platform compatibility
  - Chose tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile for atomic operations over custom temporary file handling

* **Method/Algorithm Choices:** 
  - Implemented os.path.basename() for project name extraction from git root path
  - Used datetime.now(timezone.utc) for timezone-aware timestamps
  - Applied JSON serialization for human-readable cache files
  - Implemented atomic save pattern: write to temp file � fsync � rename for ACID properties

* **Testing Strategy:** 
  - Followed strict TDD approach (RED-GREEN-REFACTOR) for all components
  - Created comprehensive test coverage with 8 test cases covering both ProjectInfo and ProjectCache
  - Included concurrent operation tests to verify thread safety
  - Used tempfile for test isolation and proper cleanup
  - Tested edge cases like non-existent files, duplicate aliases, and concurrent access

* **Other Key Decisions:** 
  - Chose to extract project name from git root basename rather than complex parsing
  - Implemented graceful degradation with empty dict return for file errors
  - Used os.fsync() to ensure data durability before atomic rename
  - Stored timestamps in ISO format for JSON serialization compatibility

### 3. Process Log
* **Actions Taken:** 
  - Created tests/test_project_models.py with comprehensive test suite
  - Implemented src/shared/project_models.py with ProjectInfo and ProjectCache classes
  - Added atomic file operations using tempfile + rename pattern
  - Verified thread safety with concurrent operation tests

* **Challenges Encountered:** 
  - Initial test setup required proper Python path configuration for imports
  - Needed to design JSON serialization format for datetime objects
  - Had to implement proper cleanup in tests using try/finally blocks

* **New Dependencies:** None - maintained zero-dependency requirement using only standard library

## Task: Phase 2 - Git Integration - Repository Detection
**Date:** 2025-07-09 20:04:58
**Status:** Success

### 1. Summary
* **Problem:** Implement GitResolver class to provide git repository detection and project name extraction functionality for the project name caching system
* **Solution:** Created robust GitResolver with get_git_root() and get_project_name_from_git_root() methods using subprocess git calls and path manipulation

### 2. Reasoning & Justification
* **Architectural Choices:** 
  - Chose simple class-based approach with two focused methods for git operations
  - Used subprocess.run() with git commands for reliable repository detection
  - Implemented timeout controls (5 seconds) to prevent hanging on slow git operations
  - Applied graceful error handling that returns None/fallback values instead of throwing exceptions

* **Library/Dependency Choices:** 
  - Used only standard library (subprocess, os, typing) to maintain project's zero-dependency philosophy
  - Chose subprocess.run() over os.system() for better error handling and security
  - Selected git rev-parse --show-toplevel as the most reliable git root detection method
  - Used os.path.basename() for simple and reliable project name extraction

* **Method/Algorithm Choices:** 
  - Implemented `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` for git root detection (industry standard approach)
  - Used os.path.normpath() and path manipulation for handling trailing slashes and edge cases
  - Applied timeout mechanism to prevent indefinite hangs on git operations
  - Chose fallback return values ('unknown', None) over exceptions for better integration

* **Testing Strategy:** 
  - Followed strict TDD approach (RED-GREEN-REFACTOR) for all functionality
  - Created comprehensive test coverage with 9 test cases covering normal and edge cases
  - Used unittest.mock for testing error scenarios (timeouts, command failures)
  - Tested real git repository operations using current project directory
  - Included edge case testing (non-git directories, nonexistent paths, trailing slashes)

* **Other Key Decisions:** 
  - Implemented special handling for root directory edge case ('/' -> 'root')
  - Used absolute path validation to ensure reliable git root detection
  - Added comprehensive error handling for all subprocess failure modes
  - Designed API to be consistent with overall project architecture patterns

### 3. Process Log
* **Actions Taken:** 
  - Created tests/test_git_resolver.py with comprehensive test suite (9 tests)
  - Implemented src/shared/git_resolver.py with GitResolver class
  - Added get_git_root() method with subprocess git calls and error handling
  - Implemented get_project_name_from_git_root() with path manipulation logic
  - Added timeout controls and graceful error handling for all failure modes
  - Created comprehensive edge case tests using mocks and real scenarios

* **Challenges Encountered:** 
  - Initial issue with root directory normalization - os.path.normpath('/') returned '.'
  - Fixed by handling root directory case before normalization
  - Needed to design proper error handling strategy for subprocess failures
  - Required careful testing of git command edge cases and timeouts

* **New Dependencies:** None - maintained zero-dependency requirement using only standard library (subprocess, os, typing)

## Task: Phase 3 - Core Resolver - Main Logic Implementation
**Date:** 2025-07-09 21:38:25
**Status:** Success

### 1. Summary
* **Problem:** Implement the core ProjectNameResolver class that orchestrates all components (ProjectCache, GitResolver) to provide intelligent project name resolution with caching and fallback mechanisms
* **Solution:** Created comprehensive ProjectNameResolver with cache-first approach, adaptive learning, and graceful error handling, following TDD methodology with extensive test coverage

### 2. Reasoning & Justification
* **Architectural Choices:** 
  - Implemented cache-first approach with fast lookup before expensive git operations
  - Designed three-layer resolution: cache hit → git detection → basename fallback
  - Used dependency injection pattern for ProjectCache and GitResolver for better testability
  - Applied adaptive learning by automatically creating aliases for subdirectories
  - Implemented graceful degradation with fallback mechanisms for all error scenarios

* **Library/Dependency Choices:** 
  - Used only standard library (os, typing) to maintain project's zero-dependency philosophy
  - Leveraged existing ProjectCache and GitResolver implementations from previous phases
  - Avoided complex dependency injection frameworks, using simple constructor injection
  - Chose standard library os.path.basename() for fallback project name extraction

* **Method/Algorithm Choices:** 
  - Implemented cache lookup with both direct path and alias matching for comprehensive coverage
  - Used lazy evaluation approach - cache first, then git operations only when needed
  - Applied atomic cache updates with full data load-modify-save cycle for consistency
  - Implemented alias creation logic that distinguishes between git root and subdirectories
  - Used early return pattern to optimize performance critical paths

* **Testing Strategy:** 
  - Followed strict TDD approach (RED-GREEN-REFACTOR) with comprehensive test coverage
  - Created 15 test cases covering all scenarios: cache hits, misses, errors, edge cases
  - Tested adaptive learning behavior with deep subdirectory navigation
  - Included concurrent access simulation to verify thread safety considerations
  - Added comprehensive error handling tests: cache corruption, git failures, None inputs
  - Used unittest.mock for isolating git operations and testing error scenarios

* **Other Key Decisions:** 
  - Handled None and empty path inputs gracefully with 'unknown' fallback
  - Implemented cache miss detection with both direct path and alias matching
  - Added configuration constants (DEFAULT_PROJECT_CACHE_FILE) for standardization
  - Created utility function get_project_cache_file_path() for consistent path handling
  - Designed API to never return None - always provides some project name for stability

### 3. Process Log
* **Actions Taken:** 
  - Created comprehensive test suite with 15 test cases in tests/test_project_name_resolver.py
  - Implemented ProjectNameResolver class with resolve_project_name() main method
  - Added private helper methods _lookup_in_cache() and _update_cache() for separation of concerns
  - Created configuration constants DEFAULT_PROJECT_CACHE_FILE in constants.py
  - Added utility function get_project_cache_file_path() in utils.py
  - Fixed timing issue in project models test with small delay for timestamp comparison
  - Verified all tests pass: 15 tests for ProjectNameResolver, 8 for ProjectModels, 9 for GitResolver

* **Challenges Encountered:** 
  - Initial timing issue with last_accessed timestamp comparison in existing tests
  - Fixed by adding small delay (0.001s) to ensure measurable timestamp differences
  - Needed to handle various edge cases: None paths, empty strings, cache corruption
  - Required careful consideration of cache update patterns for thread safety
  - Designed comprehensive error handling to ensure system never crashes

* **New Dependencies:** None - maintained zero-dependency requirement using only standard library and existing components from Phase 1 and Phase 2

## Task: Phase 4 - Hook Integration - Refactoring Existing Code
**Date:** 2025-07-09 22:01:22
**Status:** Success

### 1. Summary
* **Problem:** Replace the existing `find_project_root()` function in all hook files with the new `get_project_name_cached()` function that utilizes the ProjectNameResolver system for intelligent project name caching
* **Solution:** Created `get_project_name_cached()` utility function and refactored all three hooks (notification_hook.py, stop_hook.py, activity_hook.py) to use the new cached resolver system

### 2. Reasoning & Justification
* **Architectural Choices:** 
  - Implemented new `get_project_name_cached()` function in `hook_utils.py` to maintain API compatibility
  - Used dependency injection pattern with ProjectNameResolver for better testability
  - Applied graceful error handling with fallback to basename for compatibility
  - Maintained consistent interface across all hook files for uniform behavior

* **Library/Dependency Choices:** 
  - Used existing ProjectNameResolver system from previous phases to maintain consistency
  - Leveraged standard library imports (os, sys) for path handling
  - Chose to extend existing hook_utils.py instead of creating new module to maintain project structure
  - Avoided external dependencies to maintain project's zero-dependency philosophy

* **Method/Algorithm Choices:** 
  - Implemented cache-first approach through ProjectNameResolver.resolve_project_name()
  - Used os.getcwd() as default fallback when no path is provided
  - Applied try-catch error handling with basename fallback for robustness
  - Chose to replace function calls directly rather than function name aliasing for clarity

* **Testing Strategy:** 
  - Followed strict TDD approach with comprehensive test coverage (6 tests for hook_utils, 5 integration tests)
  - Created unit tests to verify new function behavior in isolation
  - Developed integration tests to verify all hooks work together consistently
  - Used mock patching to test error scenarios and verify correct function calls
  - Included real-world git repository tests to validate actual resolver integration

* **Other Key Decisions:** 
  - Maintained backward compatibility by keeping same function signature pattern
  - Updated all three hook files (notification_hook.py, stop_hook.py, activity_hook.py) for consistency
  - Used proper mock patching strategies to test where functions are used, not where they're defined
  - Implemented comprehensive cleanup in tearDown methods to prevent test isolation issues

### 3. Process Log
* **Actions Taken:** 
  - Created comprehensive test suite for get_project_name_cached() function with 6 test cases
  - Implemented get_project_name_cached() function in hooks/hook_utils.py with ProjectNameResolver integration
  - Refactored notification_hook.py to use get_project_name_cached() instead of find_project_root()
  - Refactored stop_hook.py to use get_project_name_cached() instead of find_project_root()
  - Refactored activity_hook.py to use get_project_name_cached() instead of find_project_root()
  - Created integration tests with 5 test cases to verify all hooks work consistently
  - Verified backward compatibility by running full test suite (282 tests passed)

* **Challenges Encountered:** 
  - Initial mock patching issues in integration tests - needed to patch functions where they're imported, not where they're defined
  - Test cleanup issues with temporary directories containing subdirectories - solved by using shutil.rmtree() instead of os.rmdir()
  - Required proper test isolation and mock setup to verify function calls correctly

* **New Dependencies:** None - maintained zero-dependency requirement using only standard library and existing ProjectNameResolver components from previous phases
