## Task: FAZA 1: Fundament - Modele Danych i Infrastruktura
**Date:** 2025-07-06, 13:10:00
**Status:** Success

### 1. Summary
* **Problem:** Implement foundational data models and infrastructure for Claude hooks integration to support activity session tracking alongside existing billing session monitoring
* **Solution:** Created ActivitySessionData model, extended MonitoringData with activity sessions support, and added hook-related constants following TDD approach

### 2. Reasoning & Justification
* **Architectural Choices:** Created separate ActivitySessionData class instead of extending SessionData to maintain clear separation of concerns between billing sessions (5-hour ccusage sessions) and activity sessions (Claude Code hook events). This separation allows different validation rules, lifecycle management, and field requirements for each session type.
* **Library/Dependency Choices:** Used enum.Enum for ActivitySessionStatus to ensure type safety and prevent invalid status values. Maintained consistency with existing codebase by using only standard library components and following established patterns from SessionData.
* **Method/Algorithm Choices:** Followed existing serialization patterns (to_dict, from_dict, to_json, from_json) for consistency. Used optional List[ActivitySessionData] field in MonitoringData to maintain backward compatibility - existing data without activity sessions continues to work seamlessly.
* **Testing Strategy:** Applied TDD with RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycles for all components. Comprehensive test coverage includes basic creation, serialization/deserialization, validation rules, enum usage, and integration with MonitoringData. Tests ensure both new functionality works correctly and existing functionality remains unaffected.
* **Other Key Decisions:** Added activity_sessions as optional field in MonitoringData (defaults to None) to ensure backward compatibility with existing data files. Used string values for status enum to maintain JSON serialization simplicity while providing type safety in code.

### 3. Process Log
* **Actions Taken:** 
  1. Created TDD test file for ActivitySessionData with 4 comprehensive test cases
  2. Implemented ActivitySessionData class with all required methods and validation
  3. Added ActivitySessionStatus enum with ACTIVE, WAITING, STOPPED values  
  4. Extended MonitoringData with optional activity_sessions field
  5. Updated MonitoringData serialization and validation methods
  6. Created TDD test file for hook constants
  7. Added hook-related constants to constants.py organized in logical sections
* **Challenges Encountered:** Initial enum test failure due to comparing enum object vs string value - resolved by using .value property in tests
* **New Dependencies:** Added enum import to data_models.py for ActivitySessionStatus enum
