## Task: FAZA 1: Fundament - Modele Danych i Infrastruktura
**Date:** 2025-07-06, 13:10:00
**Status:** Success

### 1. Summary
* **Problem:** Implement foundational data models and infrastructure for Claude hooks integration to support activity session tracking alongside existing billing session monitoring
* **Solution:** Created ActivitySessionData model, extended MonitoringData with activity sessions support, and added hook-related constants following TDD approach

### 2. Reasoning & Justification
* **Architectural Choices:** Created separate ActivitySessionData class instead of extending SessionData to maintain clear separation of concerns between billing sessions (5-hour ccusage sessions) and activity sessions (Claude Code hook events). This separation allows different validation rules, lifecycle management, and field requirements for each session type.
* **Library/Dependency Choices:** Used enum.Enum for ActivitySessionStatus to ensure type safety and prevent invalid status values. Maintained consistency with existing codebase by using only standard library components and following established patterns from SessionData.
* **Method/Algorithm Choices:** Followed existing serialization patterns (to_dict, from_dict, to_json, from_json) for consistency. Used optional List[ActivitySessionData] field in MonitoringData to maintain backward compatibility - existing data without activity sessions continues to work seamlessly.
* **Testing Strategy:** Applied TDD with RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycles for all components. Comprehensive test coverage includes basic creation, serialization/deserialization, validation rules, enum usage, and integration with MonitoringData. Tests ensure both new functionality works correctly and existing functionality remains unaffected.
* **Other Key Decisions:** Added activity_sessions as optional field in MonitoringData (defaults to None) to ensure backward compatibility with existing data files. Used string values for status enum to maintain JSON serialization simplicity while providing type safety in code.

### 3. Process Log
* **Actions Taken:** 
  1. Created TDD test file for ActivitySessionData with 4 comprehensive test cases
  2. Implemented ActivitySessionData class with all required methods and validation
  3. Added ActivitySessionStatus enum with ACTIVE, WAITING, STOPPED values  
  4. Extended MonitoringData with optional activity_sessions field
  5. Updated MonitoringData serialization and validation methods
  6. Created TDD test file for hook constants
  7. Added hook-related constants to constants.py organized in logical sections
* **Challenges Encountered:** Initial enum test failure due to comparing enum object vs string value - resolved by using .value property in tests
* **New Dependencies:** Added enum import to data_models.py for ActivitySessionStatus enum

## Task: FAZA 2: Implementacja Hook Scripts
**Date:** 2025-07-06, 19:57:00
**Status:** Success

### 1. Summary
* **Problem:** Implement Claude Code hooks integration system to monitor active Claude Code sessions in real-time alongside existing billing session monitoring
* **Solution:** Created complete hook scripts system with HookLogger utility, notification hook, stop hook, configuration, and documentation following TDD approach

### 2. Reasoning & Justification
* **Architectural Choices:** Implemented file-based communication pattern where hook scripts write to log files and daemon reads them. This ensures loose coupling between Claude Code hooks and the monitoring system, allowing graceful degradation when hooks aren't configured. Used separate hook scripts for notification and stop events to maintain clear separation of concerns.
* **Library/Dependency Choices:** Used only Python standard library components to maintain consistency with existing codebase. Implemented thread-safe logging with threading.Lock to prevent race conditions in daemon architecture. Used JSON for structured logging to ensure parseable data integration.
* **Method/Algorithm Choices:** Applied strategy pattern for hook event handling with separate parse/create functions for each hook type. Used timezone-aware datetime to fix deprecation warnings. Implemented default log file naming with date stamps for automatic organization. Added sys.path manipulation to allow hooks to run as standalone scripts.
* **Testing Strategy:** Applied comprehensive TDD with RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycles for all components. Created 21 new tests covering hook utilities, notification parsing, stop event handling, thread safety, error handling, and integration scenarios. Tests verify both valid and invalid input handling, environment variable configuration, and graceful degradation.
* **Other Key Decisions:** Made hook scripts executable and added shebang lines for direct execution. Implemented environment variable configuration (CLAUDE_ACTIVITY_LOG_FILE) to allow custom log file paths. Added comprehensive documentation in README.md explaining optional nature of hooks and integration steps.

### 3. Process Log
* **Actions Taken:**
  1. Created TDD test file for HookLogger with 4 comprehensive test cases including thread safety
  2. Implemented HookLogger class with thread-safe JSON logging and atomic file operations
  3. Created TDD test file for notification_hook with 7 test cases covering parsing and main function
  4. Implemented notification_hook.py with stdin parsing and event logging
  5. Created TDD test file for stop_hook with 10 test cases covering normal/subagent stop types
  6. Implemented stop_hook.py with termination event handling and stop type detection
  7. Created claude_hooks_config.json configuration file for Claude Code integration
  8. Updated README.md with comprehensive hooks configuration documentation
  9. Fixed import issues by adding sys.path manipulation for standalone script execution
  10. Made hook scripts executable and verified manual testing works correctly
* **Challenges Encountered:** Initial import errors when running hooks as standalone scripts - resolved by adding sys.path manipulation to allow imports from project root. Timezone deprecation warnings - fixed by using timezone-aware datetime objects.
* **New Dependencies:** No new external dependencies - maintained standard library only approach

## Task: FAZA 3: Session Activity Tracker
**Date:** 2025-07-06, 18:30:00  
**Status:** Success

### 1. Summary
* **Problem:** Implement Session Activity Tracker to read and process Claude Code hook logs and integrate them with the existing data collector system
* **Solution:** Created complete session activity tracking system with HookLogParser, SessionActivityTracker, and DataCollector integration following TDD approach with 26 comprehensive tests

### 2. Reasoning & Justification
* **Architectural Choices:** Used three-layer architecture: (1) HookLogParser for parsing individual log lines with robust error handling, (2) SessionActivityTracker for managing session state with caching and background updates, (3) DataCollector integration with graceful degradation. This separation ensures modularity and testability while maintaining backwards compatibility.
* **Library/Dependency Choices:** Maintained Python standard library only approach for consistency. Added threading support for SessionActivityTracker background updates, timezone-aware datetime handling for consistent timestamp parsing, and file watching capabilities using os.path.getmtime for efficient cache invalidation.
* **Method/Algorithm Choices:** Implemented TDD with RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycles for all components. Used session merging algorithm to consolidate multiple events for same session_id (notification â†’ stop transitions). Applied caching strategy with file modification time checking to avoid unnecessary re-parsing. Used defensive programming with graceful degradation when hooks are unavailable.
* **Testing Strategy:** Created 26 comprehensive tests covering: (1) HookLogParser with 8 tests for JSON parsing, timestamp handling, and error cases, (2) SessionActivityTracker with 11 tests for caching, file discovery, session management, and background updates, (3) DataCollector integration with 7 tests for backwards compatibility, error handling, and statistics. Tests cover both valid and invalid inputs, thread safety, and edge cases.
* **Other Key Decisions:** Implemented backwards compatibility by making activity tracker optional in DataCollector - system works perfectly without hooks configured. Added performance monitoring with statistics tracking (cache hit ratios, processing metrics). Used thread-safe operations with RLock for concurrent access. Implemented proper cleanup mechanisms with configurable retention periods.

### 3. Process Log
* **Actions Taken:**
  1. **Task 3.1**: Created HookLogParser with TDD - 8 tests covering JSON parsing, timestamp validation, and ActivitySessionData creation
  2. **Task 3.2**: Implemented SessionActivityTracker with advanced features - 11 tests covering caching, file watching, session management, background updates, and statistics
  3. **Task 3.3**: Integrated with DataCollector - 7 tests covering backwards compatibility, error handling, graceful degradation, and statistics methods
  4. **Verification**: All 242 tests pass including 26 new Phase 3 tests, confirming full integration success
* **Challenges Encountered:** Initial timestamp validation issue with ActivitySessionData requiring end_time > start_time for stop events - resolved by using timedelta subtraction. Mocking issues in tests requiring proper attribute setup for _active_sessions access pattern.
* **New Dependencies:** Added threading import for background updates, timedelta for timestamp manipulation, pathlib for file operations - all standard library components
