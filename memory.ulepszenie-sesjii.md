## Task: Phase 2 - Session Cleanup Logic Improvements
**Date:** 2025-01-07
**Status:** Success

### 1. Analysis
From the epic plan, I need to work on Phase 2 which involves:
- Task 2.1: Implementing improved cleanup logic for 5h billing window
- Task 2.2: Integration with daemon for automatic cleanup

Current state analysis:
- The `cleanup_completed_billing_sessions()` method already exists in `session_activity_tracker.py`
- It's designed to clear activity sessions outside the 5h billing window
- The method clears the log file and memory cache
- Issue: May not be called properly by the daemon or has timing issues

### 2. Action Plan
1. **Create comprehensive test**: Write `test_billing_window_cleanup` to verify the cleanup behavior
2. **Analyze current implementation**: Check if `cleanup_completed_billing_sessions()` works correctly
3. **Fix any issues**: Improve the method if needed
4. **Integration testing**: Ensure daemon calls the cleanup method
5. **Daemon integration**: Add proper calls to the main daemon loop

### 2. Reasoning & Justification

**Architectural Choices:**
- **Method Enhancement over Rewrite**: Enhanced the existing `cleanup_completed_billing_sessions()` method rather than creating a new class structure. This maintains backward compatibility and leverages existing infrastructure.
- **Daemon Integration Pattern**: Added SessionActivityTracker as a component of ClaudeDaemon, following the same pattern as DataCollector and NotificationManager. This provides consistent lifecycle management.
- **File-based Communication**: Continued using the existing file-based approach for daemon-client communication, ensuring no breaking changes to the architecture.

**Method/Algorithm Choices:**
- **Separate Logic for Old vs Recent Sessions**: Modified the logic to always remove old sessions from memory while only clearing the log file if ALL sessions are old. This provides more granular cleanup behavior.
- **5-Hour Billing Window**: Used a hard-coded 5-hour window as specified in the business requirements, matching Anthropic's billing session logic.
- **Defensive Error Handling**: Wrapped cleanup calls in try-catch blocks to ensure daemon stability even if cleanup fails.

**Testing Strategy:**
- **TDD Methodology**: Followed strict RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycles with 3 comprehensive test cases covering: all-old sessions (clears log), mixed old/recent sessions (preserves recent), and all-recent sessions (no changes).
- **Integration Testing**: Created daemon integration tests to verify the cleanup method is called automatically during normal operation, using mocking to isolate behavior.
- **Edge Case Coverage**: Tested boundary conditions including exactly 5h, just under 5h, and well over 5h time differences.

**Library/Dependency Choices:**
- **Standard Library Only**: No new dependencies were added, maintaining the project's goal of using only Python standard library.
- **unittest Framework**: Used the existing unittest framework for consistency with the project's testing approach.
- **Mock Integration**: Used unittest.mock for isolation testing without requiring external mock libraries.

**Other Key Decisions:**
- **Periodic Cleanup Frequency**: Integrated cleanup with the existing data collection cycle (every 10 seconds by default) rather than creating a separate timer. This reduces complexity and ensures cleanup happens regularly without additional threads.
- **Log File Truncation Strategy**: Used file truncation (open with 'w' mode) rather than file deletion to maintain file permissions and avoid potential race conditions with log writers.
- **Memory Cache Reset**: Ensured file modification cache and timestamps are reset when the log file is cleared, preventing stale cache issues.

### 3. Process Log

**Actions Taken:**
1. Created comprehensive test suite with 3 test cases in `test_session_activity_tracker.py`
2. Fixed existing `cleanup_completed_billing_sessions()` logic in `session_activity_tracker.py`
3. Added SessionActivityTracker import and initialization to `claude_daemon.py`
4. Integrated cleanup calls into the daemon's `_collect_data()` method
5. Created daemon integration tests in `test_daemon.py`
6. Verified all 262 tests pass with no regressions

**Challenges Encountered:**
- Initial test logic was incorrect - expected all sessions to be removed even when recent sessions should be preserved
- MonitoringData test fixtures required all fields to be provided for proper mocking
- Original daemon test was too aggressive with mocking, preventing the actual cleanup integration from being tested

**New Dependencies:** 
None - all changes used existing Python standard library and project infrastructure.
